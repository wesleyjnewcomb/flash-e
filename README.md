## [Flash-E](https://flash-e.herokuapp.com)
Flash-E is a flashcard app that allows users to create decks of flashcards and then practice through them to better the knowledge of whatever material they want. While practicing their decks or other people's decks, the user can remove cards that they feel confident in from their practice set â€“ this will prevent that card from showing up again until the user resets their practice set to include all cards.

Flash-E makes heavy use of React and React Router to provide a single-page experience for the user. It is built on top of a Ruby on Rails backend with PostgreSQL as the database. It uses Google OAuth2 for user authentication.

Flash-E was developed during Breakable Toy weeks as part of Launch Academy's curriculum.
